      <h2>Layers of the Ocean</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sunlight Zone</strong>: Where most of the visible light exists, and most ocean life is found.</li>
        <li><strong>Twilight Zone</strong>: Less light penetrates this zone, and the animals adapt with bioluminescence.</li>
        <li><strong>Midnight Zone</strong>: A dark, cold environment with high pressure, yet still home to many species.</li>
        <li><strong>The Abyss</strong>: Near freezing temperatures and sparse lifeforms characterize this zone.</li>
      </ul>
